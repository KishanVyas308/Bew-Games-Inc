# 🔧 EmailJS Template Fix Guide

## The Problem
Your EmailJS template is currently sending emails **TO** the customer instead of **TO** your business email. Here's how to fix it:

## 🚨 **URGENT FIX NEEDED**

### Step 1: Edit Your EmailJS Template
1. Go to [EmailJS Dashboard](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin)
2. Click on **Email Templates**
3. Find your template `template_3dmaalu` and click **Edit**

### Step 2: Fix Template Settings
In the template editor, make sure these settings are EXACTLY like this:

**EMAIL SETTINGS (Top section):**
```
To Email: support@bewgames.com
From Name: Bew Games Contact Form
From Email: {{user_email}}
Reply To: {{user_email}}
```

**SUBJECT:**
```
New Contact from {{user_name}}: {{user_subject}}
```

**CONTENT:**
```
Hello Bew Games Support Team,

You have received a new message from your website contact form:

Name: {{user_name}}
Email: {{user_email}}
Subject: {{user_subject}}

Message:
{{user_message}}

---
Reply directly to this email to respond to the customer.

Sent via Bew Games Contact Form
```

### Step 3: Save and Test
1. Click **Save**
2. Test your website form again
3. You should now receive emails at `support@bewgames.com`

## ✅ **Expected Result After Fix:**
- Emails will be sent **TO**: `support@bewgames.com`
- Emails will be **FROM**: `customer@email.com` (customer's email)
- You can **reply directly** to respond to the customer
- Subject will show: "New Contact from [Customer Name]: [Their Subject]"

## 🐛 **Current Issue:**
- EmailJS is using the customer's email as the "To" field
- This happens when template variables are not mapped correctly
- The fix above corrects the mapping

## 📧 **Template Variable Mapping:**
- `{{user_name}}` = Customer's name
- `{{user_email}}` = Customer's email
- `{{user_subject}}` = Message subject
- `{{user_message}}` = Message content

After making these changes, your contact form should work perfectly!
